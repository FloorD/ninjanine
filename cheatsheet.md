###IT DOES NOT WORK

####Have you checked... 
######Did you save your changes?
######Did you restart the server?
(using ```rails s``` or ```rails server```)
######Did you run bundle?
After adding gems to your Gemfile, did you run ```bundle``` in the terminal?
######Did you run ...
``` rake db:migrate ```

######Bonus: are you using Rails 4?
Run ```rails -v``` in your terminal to figure out which version of Rails you are using. It helps you Google your error messages, plus: a few problems with the Rails Girls (follow-up) guides are related to the Rails version you're using. Make sure to tell your coach what version you're running!
