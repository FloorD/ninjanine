### Did you save your changes?

   Most editors use a combination of Control-S (Command-S) or you can use File&rarr;Save from the menu.

### Did you restart the server?

   First: Stop the server. Find the Terminal you started the server in and press 'CTRL-C'.

   If you find yourself on the command prompt, cool. If not, try pressing 'CTRL-Q', then 'CTRL-C'. If in doubt, ask the
   next coach.

   Second: Start the server using ``rails s`` or ``rails server``.
