###IT DOES NOT WORK

####Have you checked... 
######Did you save your changes?  
######Did you restart the server?  
(using ```rails s``` or ```rails server```)
######Did you run bundle?
After adding gems to your Gemfile, did you run ```bundle``` in the terminal?  
######Did you run ...  
``` rake db:migrate ```  
######Did you check for typo's in your code?  

######Bonus: are you using Rails 4?  
Run ```rails -v``` in your terminal to figure out which version of Rails you are using. It helps you Google your error messages, plus: a few problems with the Rails Girls (follow-up) guides are related to the Rails version you're using. Make sure to tell your coach what version you're running!  

####Handling error messages
#######Don't panic  
#######Google or 'stackoverflow' the error message  
Google or 'stackoverflow' the error message you see in your terminal or on your localhost:3000, with the addition of your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) and possibly the version of Ruby or Rails you're currently using.  
#######Ask your coach for help
