###Crash Course HTML & CSS

Every webpage you look at is written in a language called HTML. You can think of HTML as the skeleton that gives every webpage structure. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Hypertext means "text with links in it."

A markup language is a programming language used to make text do more than just sit on a page: it can turn text into images, links, tables, lists, and much more. HTML is the markup language we'll be learning. What makes webpages pretty? That's CSSâ€”Cascading Style Sheets. Think of it like skin and makeup that covers the bones of HTML.  

####featuring: dinosaurs!

We're going to create a simple website about dinosaurs. Ready? The first thing we should do is set up the skeleton of the page. Open your texteditor and paste in: 

<pre>
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
  <head>  
    <title>  
    </title>  
  </head>  
  <body>  
  </body>  
</html>  
</pre>  

... and save the document as index.html.  

Notice how every element has an opening and a closing tag (the things between angle brackets)? Cool, then you got the basics of HTML syntax!  
Let's go through the code we just wrote! The ``` <!DOCTYPE html> ``` is just there to show off that this is indeed a HTML document. 
The stuff we'll put between the ```<head>``` tags will make for the title of the website, and we'll link to our stylesheet from here.  
Everythink in between the ```<body>``` tags will contain what we'll see in the browser.  
  
Let's add some content, shall we? Beginning with some headers. From big, to big-ish, to smaller, we've got: ```<h1>```, ```<h2>```, ```<h3>```, ```<h4>```, ```<h5>``` and ```<h6>```. How big are we talking about?  

#Supersaurus  
134 feet long (41 m)  
##Argentinosaurus  
115-130 feet long (35-40 m)  
###Seismosaurus  
nicknamed "Earth-shaking lizard", this baby was 120+ feet long (37 m)  
####Ultrasauros  
100+ feet long (30 m)  
#####Diplodocus  
grew up to 90 feet long (28 m)  
######Brachiosaurus  
about 85 feet long (26 m)  

After a header, we can create a paragraph. Paragraphs need opening and closing ```<p></p>```: 

<pre>
<body>  
  <h1></h1>  
    <p></p>  
    <h2></h2>  
      <p></p>  
</body>   
</pre>  


```src``` stands for "source." It tells the ```<img>``` link where the picture comes from!  

<pre>
<img src="" />  
</pre>

Additionally, you could link a picture, to for instance, a [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaurs).

<pre>
<a href=""><img src="" /></a>  
</pre>
