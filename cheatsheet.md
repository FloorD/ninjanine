###Bonus: are you using Rails 4?
Run ```rails -v``` in your terminal to figure out which version of Rails you are using. It helps you Google your error messages, plus: a few problems with the Rails Girls (follow-up) guides are related to the Rails version you're using. Make sure to tell your coach what version you're running!
