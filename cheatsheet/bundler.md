## My server/console/rake task does not run!

### Did you run bundle?

After adding gems to your Gemfile, did you run `bundle` or `bundle install` in the terminal?

**Hint:**

If trying to run `rails`, `rake` or `bundle check` gives you the error message *Your Gemfile's dependencies could not be satisified*, you should run `bundle` or `bundle install` again and pay attention to eventual error messages.
   
Those error messages might either help you find the problem yourself, or if in doubt, ask a coach.

### Did you run all migrations?

If the error is something like "... has no field _xy_" or "wrong datatype" or "Migrations pending" or anything similar, you should try to run ``rake db:migrate``.

If this doesn't resolve the problem (or shows error messages like "Table _XY_ already exists", you might want to run ``rake db:migrate:reset`` or ``rake db:drop && rake db:create &&
ake db:migrate`` to re-initialize your workspace.
