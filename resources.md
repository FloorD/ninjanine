#####Oh hi! So we are Laura and Floor and we'd like to share a little bit about ourselves and what resources we use to continue learning Ruby on Rails and programming.

Hej, I'm Laura. I'm originally from Italy, grew up in France, moved to Austria about 13 years ago, and also lived in Norway for a little while. I attended the first RailsGirls Vienna in January and got hooked; one thing led to another, and I'm now working part-time as a Junior Developer at [Bitstem][17]. I regularly attend Vienna.rb and this is my first time coaching at a RailsGirls event!  

Hi. My name is Floor. Two years ago I exchanged Rotterdam for Vienna to work at a startup that used Ruby on Rails. Cool thing is that many of my developer coworkers had coached at Rails Girls events, and I was familiar with their program. I started going though their courses, in August last year, supported by one of my coworkers. I organized Rails Girls Rotterdam in January, organizing [Rails Girls The Hague][1] in September, I co-organize the [Ruby user group meetups in Vienna][2] and the [PyLadies workshops in Vienna][3]. I currently work at [Usersnap][4] and spend the little time that is left coaching at Rails Girls events and helping out where I can when it comes to [Rails Girls Summer of Code][5].

####Resources

**Laura:**  
-  [Jessie learns to code][14] - tips, tricks, and ranting from a girl learning how to code
-  [Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial][15] - this one's pretty tough for a beginner, but don't give up!
-  [RailsCasts][16] - though the screencasts tend to be pretty specific, they're very useful for getting to know some gems or solving problems.
- [Rails/Ruby/Command Line Cheatsheet][18] - okay, everyone needs those.

**Floor:**  
-  [jenniferdewalt.com][6] - building a website a day  
-  [Codecademy.com][7] - Codecademy is a great resource to learn Web Fundamentals (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and programming languages like Ruby, or Python.
-  [Rails for Zombies][8] - 5 free videos with interactive code quizzes from Code School  
-  [GitImmersion][9] & [TryGit][13] - understanding git  
-  [RubyTapas][10] - Short screencasts twice a week will introduce you to a wide variety of intermediate to advanced Ruby concepts and techniques, as well as core Object-Oriented design principles.  
-  [RubyRogues][11] - You understand about 20% in the beginning, but make sure to pause the episode, look stuff up and you'll get to know the lingo pret-ty fast. 
-  Go to [a Ruby user group][12] and find a mentor!!  

Happy coding!
