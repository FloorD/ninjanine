## There's that ugly error instead of my page!

### Did you check for typos in your code?

   There's various reasons why rails code won't run. If the message contains 'Syntax Error', then Most likely it's
   because you have a missing closing parenthesis ``)`` or curly brace ``}``

   If the message contains 'nil has no function' or 'would output the object id of nil', then you might have mistyped a
   variable name (e.g. omitting the ``@`` for member variables of simple letter swpa (see what I did there?) is
   responsible). Correct the error, save the file, and in case the error doesn't go away, restart the server. If that
   doesn't solve your problem - ask a coach.
